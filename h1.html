    <h3>What is CSS?</h3>
    <ol class="h11">
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
        <li>CSS describe how HTML elements are to be displayes on screen paper,or in other media</li>
        <li> <del>CSS is not Nccessary</del> <mark>CSS save a lot of work</mark> it can control the layout of multiple web pages all at onces </li>
        <li class="h12"> External styleshhet are stored in CSS files</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h3>
    <ul class="h21">
        <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML ELEMENTS</li>
        <li>Laternal - by using a style elements in the head section</li>
        <li>External - by using a lisk elements to link to as external CSS file.</li>
        <li>The most commoon way to add CSS, is to keep the styles is external CSS files <mark>In this tuorial we will inline and internal styles,</mark>because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it youself.</li>

    </ul><br>
    <P>When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID, on the other hand, applies a style to one unique element.ID is also special in that you can use a special URL, to an element and it;s used by JavaScript.</P>
    
    <p>In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted, a style or set of styles can be applied to the element.</p>
    <p>There is a wide range of selectors available.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID.Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied.</p>
